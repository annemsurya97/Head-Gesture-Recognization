*Head Gesture Recognition using 6DOF Inertial Sensors*

This project demonstrates how head gestures can be recognized from inertial sensor data (Roll, Pitch, Yaw, and Time) using machine learning and deep learning models.

We built an interactive Tkinter-based desktop app that lets you:
✔ Upload and preprocess sensor data
✔ Train and evaluate models (Perceptron, MLP, and DNN+RF hybrid)
✔ Visualize performance metrics and confusion matrices
✔ Compare models in a single graph
✔ Predict gestures on new test data
